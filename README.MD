Net::LDAP::SimpleServer
=======================

As the name suggests, this module aims to implement a simple LDAP server, 
using many components already available in CPAN.
It was thought for prototyping and/or development purposes. 
This is **NOT** intended to be a production-grade 
server, although some brave souls in small offices might use it as such.

Please refer to the MetaCPAN entry: https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::LDAP::SimpleServer for more details and examples.
