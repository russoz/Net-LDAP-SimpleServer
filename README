NAME
    Net::LDAP::SimpleServer - Minimal-configuration, read-only LDAP server

VERSION
    This document describes Net::LDAP::SimpleServer version 0.0.4

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::LDAP::SimpleServer;

        my $server = Net::LDAP::SimpleServer->new();
        my $server = Net::LDAP::SimpleServer->new( 'ldapconfig.conf' );
        $server->run();

    Using, respectively, the default configuration file, which is

        {HOME}/.perl.simpleserver.conf

    Or using a specified file as the configuration file. Alternatively, all
    the configuration can be passed as a hash reference:

        my $server = Net::LDAP::SimpleServer->new({
            port => 5000,
            data => '/path/to/data.ldif',
        });
        $server->run();

DESCRIPTION
    As the name suggests, this module aims to implement a simple LDAP
    server, using many components already available in CPAN. It can be used
    for prototyping and/or development purposes. This is NOT intended to be
    a production-grade server, altough some brave souls in small offices
    might use it as such.

    As of October 2010, the server will simply load a LDIF file and serve
    its contents through the LDAP protocol. Many operations are NOT
    available yet, notably writing into the directory tree, but we would
    like to implement that in a near future.
